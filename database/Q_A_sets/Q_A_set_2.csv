"Question","Answer"
"Which one is the most common security threat with IoT devices?","Lack of system updates when a new vulnerability is found is the most common issue with IoT devices. For most embedded systems, updating would require physical replacement of the chip, which may not be cost-effective or feasible. Therefore, many IoT devices remain vulnerable for long periods after a vulnerability is discovered."
"Which of the below is a challenge in micro-segmentation in cyber security?","The challenge with micro-segmentation is that it is extremely difficult to configure and map to business needs. Deployment of network-based micro-segmentation is not very granular because business segmentation needs are hard to map to networking constructs. This makes it hard to align security segmentation with business objectives."
"Which type of security control does micro-segmentation support?","Micro-segmentation supports logical rules rather than physical rules. It does not require physical hardware or manual interaction with the devices to implement these rules. Administrators can apply the rules to various machines without needing to physically interact with each device or the network connections."
"Which of the below methods is best for hosting streaming video files for the company’s remote users where we can ensure that the data is protected while it’s streaming?","Symmetric encryption is the best method for protecting streaming data. It offers confidentiality of data with minimal processing overhead, making it the preferred method for securing data during streaming. Other encryption methods like asymmetric encryption involve more processing and are not as efficient for streaming applications."
"Which of the below technologies does not guarantee a network’s security?","VLANs do not guarantee a network's security. VLANs are used for network segmentation to isolate traffic, but there are attacks, such as VLAN hopping, that can allow a malicious actor to see traffic from other VLANs. VLANs are designed to segment networks logically but do not inherently provide robust security."
"Which of the below VLAN configurations could be a threat to network security?","If two VLANs are configured to communicate with each other, this breaks the intended network segmentation, making the network vulnerable. If one VLAN is compromised, the attacker can potentially access the entire network. The main purpose of VLANs is to provide network segmentation; if this segmentation is compromised, the network is exposed to greater risks."
"Which of the below technologies/protocols does not necessarily provide encryption?","VPN does not necessarily provide encryption. VPN is a point-to-point connection between two hosts, allowing them to communicate. Secure communication can be provided over a VPN, but it depends on whether security protocols (such as encryption) have been selected and properly configured. VPN alone does not guarantee encryption without these additional measures."
"Which of the below technologies/devices can help to limit broadcast traffic within a network?","VLANs are commonly used to limit broadcast traffic within large networks. In large corporate environments, VLANs are used to segment the network based on department, location, or other criteria, thereby reducing the amount of broadcast traffic within each segment and improving overall network performance."
"Which concept of cybersecurity is being applied when an organization uses two-factor authentication, role-based access control, tokenization, and air-gapped networks?","The concept of 'defense in depth' is applied in this scenario. Defense in depth involves using multiple layers of security to protect systems and data. By combining different methods such as two-factor authentication, role-based access control, tokenization, and air-gapped networks, the organization is using several layers of defense to enhance overall security."
"What is the right time to plan for security?","Security should be planned during the pre-deployment phase. From the very beginning, before data is introduced into the network, a robust security plan should be in place. Once data is deployed, it is exposed to potential threats, so delaying a security plan can compromise the safety of the data. Proactive planning ensures that security measures are in place before any vulnerabilities can be exploited."
"To ensure the availability of a data center, it is best to plan for both resilience and _________ of the elements in the facility.","Redundancy is essential for ensuring the availability of data center components. Availability is achieved by replicating key elements so that if one component fails, others can take over. A lack of redundancy can create single points of failure that disrupt operations if a component malfunctions."
"How many temperature sensors are required to measure the actual operating temperature of the environment in a Data Center Rack?","It is recommended that a data center rack have three temperature sensors, positioned at the top, middle, and bottom of the rack. This setup ensures accurate monitoring of the operating temperature throughout the environment. If fewer sensors are used, there may be gaps in temperature readings, potentially leading to overheating issues."
"Which fire suppression technique is best for the data center?","Dry-pipe systems are the best option for fire suppression in data centers. These systems keep water out of the pipes over the data center until a sensor detects a fire. Since water is not constantly present in the pipes, the risk of leakage is greatly reduced. Other methods, such as sprinkler systems, may damage electronic equipment in the event of accidental discharge."
"When choosing a cable type for a data center, which cable type has the highest attenuation?","Copper cables have the highest attenuation compared to other types like glass and fiber-optic cables. Attenuation refers to the loss of signal strength as it travels through a medium, and copper wires tend to lose more signal strength over longer distances, making them less suitable for long-range communication in data centers."
"When choosing a cable type for a data center, which cable type is best for long-distance communication?","Glass cables are the best choice for long-distance communication in a data center due to their low attenuation. They allow signals to travel longer distances without significant loss of strength. While optical fiber cables are also good conductors, glass cables have even lower attenuation, making them the preferred choice for long-distance applications."
"Which of the below agreements establishes a “conditional agreement” between a client and a vendor?","A memorandum of agreement (MOA) establishes a conditional legal understanding between a client and a vendor. It outlines the terms and conditions under which both parties agree to collaborate on a project or meet a specific objective. Unlike a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which is often non-binding, an MOA is typically more formal and can have legal implications."
"Which document needs to be signed by a Managed Service Provider to protect the clients confidential information?","An NDA (non-disclosure agreement) is a legally binding agreement that ensures both the client and vendor agree not to disclose confidential information to third parties. This agreement is crucial when sensitive data is involved and ensures that proprietary information remains secure during the course of a business relationship."
"Which of the following is required to be protected by redundant power?","HVAC systems in data centers must be protected by redundant power to ensure they continue functioning even during a power failure. If HVAC systems fail, the data center could overheat, leading to potential damage to servers and other equipment."
"Purchasing server instances and configuring them to run software is an example of which cloud deployment model?","This is an example of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), where server instances are provided by a cloud service provider. The client installs their own operating system and software, managing the infrastructure remotely while the cloud provider maintains the underlying physical resources."
"As per NIST SP 800-145, which one is not a cloud characteristic?","Dedicated resource pool is not a characteristic of cloud computing. Cloud environments provide shared resources, allowing multiple users to access computing power, storage, and networks as needed. Cloud services are designed to be ubiquitous, convenient, and on-demand, but they typically do not involve dedicated resources for individual users."
"Which feature provides redundancy in the cloud model?","Different availability zones provide redundancy in cloud environments. Cloud service providers maintain multiple availability zones so that if one zone experiences an outage, workloads can be shifted to another zone without affecting service continuity."
"Which of the below could be a disadvantage of working with a managed cloud service provider (MCSP)?","One disadvantage of working with an MCSP is the lack of transparency and potential security risks. MCSPs use a multi-tenant model, which means that customer data is stored together. If one customer’s security is compromised, it could affect others. It's important to know the security protocols and certifications of your MCSP to ensure they meet your requirements."
"Which term in an SLA is not related to cloud security?","Data portability is related to the ability to move data between cloud services (e.g., migrating data from AWS to Google Cloud) and is not specifically related to security. In contrast, data location, data access, and the change management process are all related to ensuring the security of the cloud environment."
"Which of the below definitions represents the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in IT Security?","A DMZ is a network area that is designed to be accessed by outside visitors but is still isolated from the private network of the organization. The DMZ often hosts public-facing servers, such as web, email, or file servers, allowing external access without exposing the internal network."
"Which statement about defense in depth is correct?","Defense in depth is a layered approach to security, where multiple security controls (such as physical, administrative, and technological controls) are used to protect an organization's assets. This strategy ensures that if one layer of security fails, additional layers are in place to mitigate the risk."
