"Question","Answer"
"What is cybersecurity, and why is it important?","Cybersecurity protects computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. It's important to safeguard sensitive information, maintain privacy, prevent financial losses, and protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats."
"Define the term Virus.","Virus: A program that replicates itself and spreads to other files or systems, often causing harm."
"Define the term Malware.","Malware: A broader term encompassing any malicious software that disrupts or gains unauthorized access to computer systems."
"Define the term Ransomware.","Ransomware: A malicious software encrypting files or computer systems and requesting a ransom for their decryption."
"Define the term Threat.","Threat: Any potential danger or harmful event that can exploit vulnerabilities and negatively impact security. Vulnerability: Weaknesses or gaps in security measures that threats can exploit. Risk: The probability of a threat capitalizing on a vulnerability and the potential consequences or damage it may inflict."
"Define the term Vulnerability.","Vulnerability: Weaknesses or gaps in security measures that threats can exploit."
"Define the term Risk.","Risk: The probability of a threat capitalizing on a vulnerability and the potential consequences or damage it may inflict."
"What is Phishing?","Phishing: A cyberattack in which malicious actors employ deceptive emails or messages to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information. Example: An email claiming to be from a bank, requesting the recipient to provide their login credentials by clicking a link that leads to a fake website."
"How do firewalls protect network security?","Firewalls serve as protective barriers, overseeing and screening both inbound and outbound network traffic in accordance with established security regulations. They block unauthorized access and help prevent malicious data from entering or leaving a network."
"What is a VPN and why is it used?","A Virtual Private Network encrypts and secures internet connections, ensuring privacy and anonymity. It protects data from eavesdropping, accesses restricted content, and enhances public Wi-Fi security."
"Explain the concept of a secure Password.","A secure password is complex, lengthy, and difficult to guess. It comprises a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, with the requirement that this combination should be distinct for every individual account."
"What are the common techniques for securing a computer network?","Techniques include using strong passwords, regular updates and patch management, implementing firewalls, using intrusion detection systems, and conducting security audits."
"What is two-factor authentication, and why is it important?","Two-factor authentication enhances security by necessitating users to furnish two distinct forms of verification, typically a password and a temporary code, thereby bolstering protection. It's important because even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is prevented without the second factor."
"Define the terms Encryption and Decryption.","Encryption: Converting plaintext data into a coded format to protect it from unauthorized access. Decryption: Converting encrypted data back into its original, readable form."
"What is SSL encryption?","SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption is a protocol that ensures secure data transmission between a user's web browser and a website server, protecting data during transit."
"What is the difference between IDS and IPS?","IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Monitors network traffic and generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Not only detects but also actively blocks or prevents suspicious network activity."
"Explain what a security audit Is.","A security audit systematically evaluates an organization's information systems and security policies to assess their effectiveness, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements."
"What steps would you take if you discovered a security breach?","Isolate affected systems, contain the breach, notify relevant parties, investigate the incident, remediate vulnerabilities, and implement measures to prevent future breaches."
"What is social engineering? Give an example.","Social engineering manipulates individuals to disclose confidential information or perform actions for malicious purposes. Example: Pretending to be a trusted colleague and asking for login credentials over the phone."
"What are cookies in a web browser?","Cookies are stored by websites on a user's device. They are used to track user preferences, session information, and provide a personalized browsing experience."
"What is a DDoS attack and how does it work?","A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack inundates a target server or network with excessive traffic originating from numerous sources, making it inaccessible to genuine users."
"Explain what a security policy is.","A security policy comprises a collection of formally documented regulations, recommendations, and protocols that delineate an organization's methods to safeguard its information, assets, and technological resources."
"What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?","Symmetric Encryption uses a similar key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric Encryption employs a pair of keys, one public and one private. Data that is encrypted with one key can only be deciphered using the complementary key."
"How can you prevent a Man-In-The-Middle attack?","Use secure communication protocols, verify digital certificates, and avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions. Implementing strong encryption also helps."
"What is a honeypot in cybersecurity?","A honeypot is a decoy system or network designed to attract attackers. It allows security professionals to study their tactics, techniques, and motivations."
"Explain the concept of a digital signature.","A digital signature employs cryptographic methods to confirm the genuineness and unaltered state of a digital document or message, assuring both the sender's authenticity and the content's integrity."
"What is a brute force attack?","It involves attackers employing a trial-and-error approach to find a password or encryption key by systematically testing every conceivable combination until they discover the correct one."
"What are the common cyber threats today?","Common threats include malware, ransomware, phishing, DDoS attacks, insider threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities."
"What is the role of patch management in maintaining security?","Patch management regularly applies updates and patches to software and systems to fix security vulnerabilities. It's crucial for preventing the exploitation of known weaknesses by attackers."
